meanwhile, a court document filed friday showed suspect james holmes was a patient of a university of colorado psychiatrist before last week's attack at a movie theater that killed 12 people and wounded scores.
one of them, ashley moser, underwent "an additional surgery" on saturday morning and also suffered a miscarriage due to "the extreme trauma she sustained," her family said in a statement.
ghawi was among the 12 killed in the july 20 mass shooting at a movie theater in aurora, colorado.
according to holmes' request, the package seized by authorities under a july 23 search warrant was a protected communication.
