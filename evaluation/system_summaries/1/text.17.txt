alleged boston bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev was semi-conscious, wrapped in field gauze and "covered in blood" when he arrived late friday at beth israel hospital in boston, according to a detailed first-hand account from a senior employee at the hospital.
at devens, he is locked inside a 10-by-10-foot cell with a steel door, a slot for food and an observation window, a prison spokesman said sunday.
the fbi was inside the trauma room during the stabilization and several other law enforcement agencies were outside the room, including the fbi, boston police and beth israel police, according to the source.
the source said tsarnaev appeared to have lost a great deal of blood and was making no sound until he reached the red zone trauma area, where he began to moan in considerable pain.
