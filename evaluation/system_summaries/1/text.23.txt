a garbage truck emptied that dumpster that friday -- the same day that tsarnaev was finally captured, hurting from apparent gunshot wounds to his head, neck and legs and hand, in the back of a boat parked in a watertown, massachusetts, backyard.
the night of thursday, april 18, authorities say that dzhokhar and tamerlan tsarnaev were on the run -- allegedly responsible for killing a massachusetts institute of technology police officer, carjacking a mercedes suv, then tossing explosives and trading gunfire with authorities on a high-speed chase through boston suburbs.
and on wednesday, kadyrbayev, tazhayakov and phillipos were in court accused of covering up for their friend, and hampering an investigation into the bloody attacks that jarred a city and a nation.
according to tazhayakov's account in the affidavit, while they were eating together about a month before the bombing, tsarnaev told them he knew how to make a bomb.
