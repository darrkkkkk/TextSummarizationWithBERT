of the scores of people injured in the blasts, 17 remain in five boston-area hospitals, though none is in critical condition, according to information the hospitals provided to cnn on thursday.
those are the items federal prosecutors say azamat tazhayakov, dias kadyrbayev and robel phillipos took from tsarnaev's dorm room at the university of massachusetts-dartmouth in the hours after the fbi released photos of tsarnaev and his brother tamerlan, the suspects in the marathon bombings.
about a month before the marathon attack, tsarnaev had told kadyrbayev and tazhayakov "that he knew how to make a bomb," according to an fbi affidavit recounting the charges.
federal law enforcement sources said at the time that the kazakh students were being detained "in an abundance of caution" because authorities wanted detailed information on the tsarnaevs' movements in the weeks and days before the attack.
