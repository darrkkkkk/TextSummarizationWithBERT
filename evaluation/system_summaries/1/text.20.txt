the fbi and the cia are being criticized for not keeping better track of tamerlan tsarnaev in the months before the boston marathon bombings.
millions of people behave strangely enough to warrant the fbi's notice, and almost all of them are harmless.
but before a terrorist attack, when there are millions of dots -- some important but the vast majority unimportant -- uncovering plots is a lot harder.
we have to accept that there always will be a risk of terrorism, and that when the occasional plot succeeds, it's not necessarily because our law enforcement systems have failed.
