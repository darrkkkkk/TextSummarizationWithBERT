while the news came out friday, bukhari abdel-alim from the islamic funeral services of richmond said tsarnaev was actually buried the previous morning.
the death certificate released by massachusetts authorities indicates that tsarnaev, whose cause of death was listed as gunshot wounds and "blunt trauma to (his) head and torso," was interred at al-barzakh muslim cemetery in doswell, which is about 25 minutes north of richmond in a rural county of about 30,000 people.
the body was buried in an unmarked grave in a muslim cemetery in doswell, virginia, according to tsarni.
it also appeared that sending the body overseas was an unlikely option -- tamerlan tsarnaev's parents in the russian region of dagestan said they would not fly his body back to russia for burial, citing passport problems, spokeswoman heda saratova said.
