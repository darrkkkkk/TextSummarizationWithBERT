for one, law enforcement sources told cnn last week that a woman's dna had been found on a fragment of a pressure cooker used in the attack.
now, that dna could have come from anyone -- from a clerk at the store where the tsarnaev brothers allegedly bought the pressure cookers to a victim of the bombings.
the older brother died april 19 after a firefight with police, hours after authorities released images of the suspected bombers.
authorities allege two of the men disposed of potentially incriminating items from dzhokhar's dorm room and a bag containing fireworks; the other allegedly made false statements to police.
