his parents have not asked that his body be brought to russia -- and in any event, russian law says the bodies of "terrorists" killed by government forces should be buried in an undisclosed location, without the family being notified of the site, he said.
tsarnaev and his younger brother, dzhokhar, are accused of setting off two deadly explosions at the boston marathon in april.
but tamerlan tsarnaev held a passport from the former soviet republic of kyrgyzstan, where he was born, so his remains can't be sent to russia, said zaurbek sadakhanov, a lawyer for the parents.
meanwhile on monday, a law enforcement official who spoke to cnn said that investigators believe that tsarnaev accessed inspire magazine -- an english-language magazine published by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -- on a computer in the apartment where he and his wife lived.
