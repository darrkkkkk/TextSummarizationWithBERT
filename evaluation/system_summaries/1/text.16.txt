after last week's bombings at the boston marathon, authorities had to sift through a mountain of footage from government surveillance cameras, private security cameras and imagery shot by bystanders on smartphones.
even after the identification of the boston bombing suspects through grainy security-camera images, officials say that blanketing a city in surveillance cameras can create as many problems as it solves.
in 2007, boston law enforcement had an estimated 55 cctv cameras set up around the city.
in 2008, only one crime was solved for every 1,000 cameras, according to the city's police.
