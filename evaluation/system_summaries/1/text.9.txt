authorities confirmed the man in custody is 19-year-old dzhokar tsarnaev, who escaped an overnight shootout with police that left his older brother tamerlan tsarnaev -- the other man wanted in the bombings -- dead.
the two suspects, according to authorities, then hijacked a vehicle at gunpoint in cambridge, telling the driver that they were the marathon bombers, a law enforcement source told cnn.
the violent hours leading up to the capture began in cambridge, across the charles river from boston, mit officer collier was shot and killed while he sat in his car on thursday night, the suffolk county district attorney's office said in a statement.
authorities had cast a wide net for the suspect, virtually shutting down boston and its surroundings after a violent night in which authorities say the brothers allegedly hurled explosives at pursuers, after killing massachusetts institute of technology police officer sean collier and hijacking a car.
