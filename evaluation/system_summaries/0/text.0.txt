a shooting took place inside his upscale home in pretoria, south africa, early thursday, and only the two of them were there at the time, police said.
pistorius was arrested and accused of common assault in 2009, but the case was thrown out because of a lack of evidence, police told cnn on thursday.
in november 2011, pistorius tweeted a photo of himself at a gun range, and wrote that he had "a 96% headshot over 300m from 50 shots!
pistorius is not being brought to court thursday because the public prosecutor needs more time to prepare the case, police spokeswoman katlego mogale told cnn.
