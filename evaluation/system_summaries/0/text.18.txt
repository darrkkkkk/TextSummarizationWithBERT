the pilot at the helm of asiana airlines flight 214 was training to fly a boeing 777 and was sitting next to a man in his first trip as an instructor pilot when their plane's main landing gear hit a seawall around san francisco's airport, a u.s. official said tuesday.
two other flight attendants were not in their seats at the rear of the aircraft when the plane finally ground to a halt, because they were ejected as the aircraft broke up.
at 200 feet above ground, the instructor pilot said he noted precision approach path indicator lights indicated the giant jet was too low.
having finished classroom and simulator training, the "flying pilot" -- as hersman referred to him -- was in the piloting portion of his training to fly a boeing 777 at the time of saturday's crash.
