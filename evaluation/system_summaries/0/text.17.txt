a third person, identified as a minor girl, died from injuries suffered in the asiana airlines crash last week, hospital officials said.
on friday, a southwest airlines jet landed on the runway where the crash occurred -- signifying that, for the first time in six days, all four of the airport's runways were operational.
an in-depth review of the cockpit voice recorder shows two pilots called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and crashed onto the runway, the head of the national transportation safety board said.
two others -- both 16-year-old girls from china -- were reported dead soon after the boeing 777 crash-landed at san francisco international airport.
