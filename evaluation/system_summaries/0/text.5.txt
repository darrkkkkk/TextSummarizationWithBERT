neville malila told the associated press that botha ? who gave testimony in the pistorius bail hearing on wednesday ? is scheduled to appear in court in may on seven counts of attempted murder related to an incident in october 2011 when botha and two other police officers fired at a minibus they were trying to stop.
steenkamp was hit three times, in the head, right elbow and right hip, police say, and prosecutors argue pistorius intended to kill his 29-year-old girlfriend after a fight in the early hours of valentine's day.
prosecutors said they were unaware of the charges against veteran detective hilton botha when they put him on the stand in court tuesday and wednesday to explain why pistorius, the double-amputee olympic and paralympic runner should not be given bail in the valentine's day shooting death of his girlfriend.
malila said police had learned wednesday, the same day that botha appeared in court to oppose pistorius' bail application, that the charges against botha and the two others had been reinstated by the director of public prosecutions.
