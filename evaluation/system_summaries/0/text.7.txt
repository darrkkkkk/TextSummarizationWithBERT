pistorius was formally charged at pretoria magistrate's court with one count of murder after his girlfriend, reeva steenkamp, a model and budding reality tv show participant, was shot multiple times and killed at pistorius' upmarket home in the predawn hours of thursday.
he was holding what appeared to be a white handkerchief in one hand as he was led by officers to a police van outside the boschkop police station in eastern pretoria, where he had been questioned on thursday and had spent the night in custody.
chief magistrate desmond nasir delayed pistorius' bail hearing until next tuesday and wednesday and ruled that pistorius, 26, would be held at a police station in pretoria until then.
police said the victim was shot four times at pistorius' villa in a gated community.
