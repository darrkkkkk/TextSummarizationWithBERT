among the 291 passengers were 141 chinese, 77 south koreans, 61 americans and one japanese, asiana airlines said.
in 1993, a crash near south korea's mokpo airport killed 68 of the 116 people on board.
while 182 of them were taken to hospitals with injuries ranging from spinal fractures to bruises, another 123 managed to escape unharmed.
perhaps one of the reasons so many people survived saturday's crash was because the boeing 777 is built so that everybody can get off the plane within 90 seconds, even if half the doors are inoperable.
