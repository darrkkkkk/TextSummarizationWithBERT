the attempted murder charges against botha had previously been withdrawn for additional investigation, but prosecutors decided last month to proceed, south african police service commissioner riah phiyega said.
bulelwa makeke, the spokeswoman for south africa's national prosecuting authority, said before the announcement of botha's removal that the accusations against the investigator would be little more than a "speed bump" in the pistorius case.
he argued that police had missed a bullet in the toilet of the bathroom where steenkamp was shot and may have contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective foot covers.
his removal from the high-profile murder case came just days after his testimony at a bail hearing for pistorius that included admissions that police could have contaminated the crime scene and failed to properly catalog evidence.
