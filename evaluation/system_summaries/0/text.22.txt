bonnie kate pourciau, 18, said she is "not a huge batman fan, really," but decided to go to the movie after she and her friend elizabeth sumrall stopped at a hotel in aurora en route from seattle to their homes in baton rouge, louisiana.
when the gunfire broke out, pourciau told cnn affiliate kmgh from her bed in aurora medical center, she thought it was special effects in the movie.
her friend and co-worker, alex "sully" sullivan, was shot in the head, and blache found out saturday morning that he didn't survive.
having already undergone three surgeries on her leg, pourciau said she expected to be transferred thursday to a hospital closer to her home.
