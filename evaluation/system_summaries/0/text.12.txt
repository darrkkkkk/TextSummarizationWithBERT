a third person -- identified only as a girl -- has died from injuries sustained in last week's crash of asiana airlines flight 214, officials at the san francisco hospital where she was being treated said friday.
the first internal call by one of the three pilots in the cockpit to abort the landing came three seconds before the crash and a second was made by another pilot 1.5 seconds before impact, ntsb chief deborah hersman said.
by 5:05 p.m., a southwest airlines jet landed on the runway where the crash occurred -- signifying that, for the first time in six days, all four of the airport's runways were operational.
an in-depth review of the cockpit voice recorder shows two pilots called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and crashed onto the runway, the head of the national transportation safety board said thursday.
