asiana flight 214, with 291 passengers and 16 crew members, was at the end of a more than 10-hour direct flight from seoul, south korea, when it began its descent.
according to the recorders, the flight's approach appeared normal as the 777 descended, and "there is no discussion of aircraft approach" among the crew.
the cockpit voice recorder of asiana airlines flight 214 appears to show the pilots tried to abort the landing less than two seconds before the plane crashed on the runway at san francisco international airport, the head of the national transportation safety board said sunday.
the pilot, lee kang-gook, had flown from seoul to the city several times between 1999 and 2004, the airline said.
