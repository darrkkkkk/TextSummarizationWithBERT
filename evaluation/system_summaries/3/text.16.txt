according to the guardian, the only time snowden became emotional during hours of interviews was when he thought about what might happen to his relatives -- many of whom work for the u.s. government.
snowden has revealed himself as the source of documents outlining a massive effort by the u.s. national security agency to track cell phone calls and monitor the e-mail and internet traffic of virtually all americans.
snowden said he later worked as a security guard for the nsa and then took a computer security job with the cia.
snowden told the guardian newspaper in the united kingdom that he had access to the full rosters of everyone working at the nsa, the entire intelligence community and undercover assets around the world.
