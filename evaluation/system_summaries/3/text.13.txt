kim min-seok, a spokesman for the south korean defense ministry, said the magnitude of the "artificial tremor" suggested the size of the blast could be in the order of 6 to 7 kilotons, more powerful than the north's two prior nuclear tests.
indications that the test had taken place first emerged when u.s. seismologists reported a disturbance tuesday morning in north korea centered near the site of the secretive regime's two previous atomic blasts.
the test probably took place near p'unggye and yielded "several kilotons," according to assessments cited by the u.s. director of national intelligence.
in a commentary last week, the north's kcna said that pyongyang had "drawn a final conclusion that it will have to take a measure stronger than a nuclear test to cope with the hostile forces' nuclear war moves."
