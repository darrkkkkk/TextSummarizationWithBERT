as u.s. president barack obama set a january deadline for proposals to deal with gun violence, new details emerged wednesday about the mother of the gunman who killed 27 people in a connecticut shooting rampage last week.
authorities have said the shooter took three of his mother's weapons -- two handguns and a bushmaster ar-15 rifle -- to the elementary school friday.
speaking five days after the massacre, obama said wednesday that a new group led by vice president joe biden is charged with developing "concrete proposals" for dealing with gun violence "no later than january."
less than a day later, authorities say, her son adam lanza killed her and then opened fire in sandy hook elementary school, killing 20 children and six adults there.
