the national security agency and the fbi are siphoning personal data from the main computer servers of nine major u.s. internet firms, the washington post and the london-based guardian reported thursday night.
under watch from the national security agency and the fbi, internet traffic of people outside the usa is being closely monitored by silicon valley internet giants in a massive data-snooping agreement.
the agencies are grabbing data from the servers of nine u.s. internet companies including microsoft, yahoo, google, facebook, paltalk, aol, skype, youtube and apple, according to the documents.
the post writes that the agencies are "extracting audio, video, photographs, e-mails, documents and connection logs that enable analysts to track a person's movements and contacts over time."
