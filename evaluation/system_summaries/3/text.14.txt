north korea appears to have conducted an underground nuclear bomb test tuesday, as the u.s. geological survey reported a seismic disturbance centered near the site of the secretive regime's two previous nuclear tests.
while the comprehensive test ban treaty hasn't formally become law (it awaits ratification by china, egypt, india, iran israel, north korea, pakistan and the u.s.), only north korea, india and pakistan have broken the moratorium on nuclear testing, according to the ctbto.
of the more than 2,000 nuclear detonations since 1945, 75% of the explosions have been tests conducted underground, largely by the major nuclear powers of the united states, the former soviet union (now russia), britain, france and china, according to the ctbto.
the area around the reported epicenter of the magnitude 4.9 disturbance has little or no history of earthquakes or natural seismic hazards, according to u.s. geological survey maps.
