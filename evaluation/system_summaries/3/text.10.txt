but there were critics as well, including an equally passionate, equally viral blog by writer sarah kendzior, who accused long of invading "michael's" privacy with "vindictive and cruel posts about her children in which she fantasizes about beating them, locking them up and giving them away."
she began making the rounds at the television networks before dawn on monday, appearing on nbc's "today" show, then chatting with diane sawyer over at abc and again with cnn's erin burnett.
in many of the posts, kendzior notes, long's "allegedly insane and violent son is portrayed as a normal boy who incites her wrath by being messy, buying too many apple products and supporting obama."
it struck a nerve in the wake of the mass shooting in which 20 children died at sandy hook elementary school in newtown, connecticut.
