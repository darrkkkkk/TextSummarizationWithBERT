the unnamed cbs sources said lanza saw himself as being in direct competition with breivik, who killed eight with a bombing in downtown oslo before he moved to a nearby island where he hunted down and fatally shot 69 people.
after detonating a bomb outside the prime minister's office in oslo, killing eight people, breivik took a ferry to utoya island and embarked on a shooting spree that took the lives of another 69 people attending a youth camp.
in august 2012 breivik, who boasted of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in norway, was judged to be sane at the time of the attack.
the officials, who have been briefed on the newtown, connecticut, investigation, told cbs that evidence shows lanza was likely acting out the fantasies of a video game in killing 20 children and six adults at the school.
