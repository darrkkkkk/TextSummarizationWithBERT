according to a maryland-based internet watchdog company, more than 1,000 internet domain sites with the words "sandy" or "relief" were registered either as the storm was approaching the caribbean last week or, in some cases, even before the hurricane hit.
as the northeast digs out from a second major storm in little more than a week, experts say internet scam artists are preying on generous americans who want to donate to the victims of superstorm sandy.
in one instance, a website linking sandy to the damage it caused on the island of jamaica popped up as news accounts reported the growing intensity of the storm.
on tuesday, hundreds lined up at a newark, new jersey, church to receive food, water, blankets and cleaning supplies donated by missouri-based convoy of hope.
