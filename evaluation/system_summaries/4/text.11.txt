the administration disclosure comes two days after secretary of state john kerry urged nato members to prepare for the possible use of chemical weapons by the syrian regime, while russia's foreign minister accused the west of politicizing the search for such weapons, comparing it to the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in iraq.
earlier this week an israeli intelligence official said damascus was using weapons banned under international law against its own people in the country's civil war.
on wednesday, israeli president shimon peres said that he expected the united states to fall in line with its estimate on chemical weapons use in syria.
the white house cautioned that the "chain of custody" of the chemicals was not clear and that intelligence analysts could not confirm the circumstances under which the sarin was used, including the role of syrian president bashar al-assad's regime.
