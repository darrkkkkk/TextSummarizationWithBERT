new jersey residents displaced by superstorm sandy will be allowed to vote in tuesday's elections via e-mail or fax, the first time civilians in the state have been allowed to vote remotely.
in many states, remote electronic voting is already available to members of the military and u.s. citizens living overseas, but this marks the first time that civilian residents in new jersey have been permitted to vote via e-mail.
in their announcement of the new directive, new jersey officials did not explain how they will authenticate e-mails or faxes from voters.
despite some security concerns, the state announced the change to make it easier for voters who may have been forced by flooding, power outages or other storm damage to temporarily leave their communities.
