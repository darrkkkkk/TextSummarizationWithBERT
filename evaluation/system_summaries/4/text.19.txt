after obama's speech, a military and political analyst on syrian state tv said obama is "embarrassed" that russia opposes military action against syria, is "crying for help" for someone to come to his rescue and is facing two defeats -- on the political and military levels.
the syrian government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the august 21 attack, saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against it.
u.s. secretary of state john kerry on friday cited a death toll of 1,429, more than 400 of them children.
obama sent a letter to the heads of the house and senate on saturday night, hours after announcing that he believes military action against syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons.
