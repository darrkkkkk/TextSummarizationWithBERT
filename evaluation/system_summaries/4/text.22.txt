and then, in a statement hours later, superdome officials said a piece of equipment designed to monitor the electrical load "sensed an abnormality in the system."
for 35 bewildering minutes sunday night, the super bowl showdown between the baltimore ravens and the san francisco 49ers ground to a halt when half of the lights in the new orleans superdome went out.
even audi took a swipe at its competitor, tweeting that it was sending "led lights" over to the dome, whose official name is the mercedes-benz superdome.
a majority on social media blamed it on the fans of the 49ers, who were trailing 28-to-6 in the third quarter before the blackout.
