in 2005, fema's slow and disengaged response was a major embarrassment for the george w. bush administration, particularly when top officials admitted they were unaware of thousands of people stranded at a convention center in new orleans without food and water, days after the storm hit.
by comparison, at the time of katrina, fema had manpower and planning problems and confusion about the roles of officials in responding to disasters, according to a 2006 report by the department of homeland security's inspector general.
the report said that with the destruction of communications infrastructure, it took fema officials about three days after katrina's landfall to grasp the magnitude of the hurricane's destruction.
after katrina, a senate investigation found that fema was shorthanded, failed to commit enough people to prepare for the oncoming storm, didn't have enough supplies in position and had poor communication with state and local authorities.
