a report released four months ago by the the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota found that while many studies put the efficacy of flu vaccine for healthy adults at between 70% to 90%, when they looked only at well-designed and rigorous studies it was closer to 59% for healthy adults between 18 and 64 years of age.
about 4.3% of visits to a doctor or a clinic were for influenza-like illnesses last week, above the national baseline of 2.2%, cdc said in its weekly fluview report.
michael osterholm, director of the center for infectious disease research and policy, says a careful analysis of the data shows that the flu vaccine's "match" has little to do with its effectiveness.
about 37% of americans had gotten vaccinated against the flu as of mid-november, said joseph bresee, chief of cdc's epidemiology and prevention branch.
