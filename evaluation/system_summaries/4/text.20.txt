the chemical weapons experts were working to determine what occurred in the apparent chemical weapons attack near damascus on aug. 21, which u.s. intelligence reports say left 1,429 people dead, including 426 children.
obama's remarks on saturday afternoon came hours after united nations experts, who had been collecting samples from last week's alleged chemical weapons strike outside damascus, left syria bound for the netherlands.
the white house had determined earlier this summer that assad's regime had previously used chemical weapons against rebels and civilians on a small scale, but had resisted taking action or offering any significant new military aid to the rebel groups.
obama indicated last saturday during a national security council meeting that he was leaning toward taking action against syria, but had not made a final decision, said the official, who asked not to be identified to discuss internal deliberations.
