newser -- turns out there is a cool use for trigonometry: scientists in colombia have been able to calculate the trajectory of the meteor that injured 1,000 in russia this month using data gleaned from local camera footage and a lake landing spot.
volunteer skiers traversed 31 miles of its debris field this weekend, picking up more than 100 pieces, the largest of which weighs in at about 2.2 pounds.
once they determined the meteor's path through the atmosphere, they were then able to trace its orbit around the sun, the bbc reports.
scientists then plugged that data into astronomy software, which showed that the meteor was part of the so-called apollo asteroid group, which have earth-crossing orbits.
