two federal public defenders in boston -- william fick and miriam conrad -- were in the hospital room april 22 when tsarnaev had his first court appearance, and had his miranda rights first read to him by federal magistrate marianne bowler.
washington some very preliminary talks have been under way "for the past few days" to potentially allow boston bomb suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev to resume providing investigators with information about the attacks in exchange for having the death penalty taken off the table, two government sources say.
he and his brother, tamerlan, are suspected of detonating two explosive devices at the boston marathon race april 15, leaving three dead and more than 175 people wounded.
tsarnaev's lawyers must weigh the initial evidence the government has presented against their client, and the strength of any additional charges that may be added when a formal indictment is presented in coming weeks.
