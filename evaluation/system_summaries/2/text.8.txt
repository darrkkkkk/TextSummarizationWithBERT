in a statement issued late friday, the fbi said that "in early 2011, a foreign government asked the fbi for information about tamerlan tsarnaev ... based on information that he was a follower of radical islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the united states for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups."
his father, speaking from the russian republic of dagestan on friday, said tamerlan was religious but in a peaceful way.
in a statement in june 2010, the u.s. state department's coordinator for counterterrorism, daniel benjamin, said umarov posed threats to the united states and russia and that his attacks "illustrate the global nature of the terrorist problem we face today."
russian security services killed dolgatov in december during an assault on an apartment in makhachkala, the capital of the russian caucasus republic of dagestan.
