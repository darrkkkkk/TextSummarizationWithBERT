the new york times reported wednesday it had been the target of four months of cyber assaults, which started during an investigation by the newspaper into the wealth reportedly accumulated by relatives of the chinese premier, wen jiabao.
in the case of the investigation into wen's family's finances, much of the information came from public records.
one-third of all observed computer attacks from july through september last year came from china, according to a report last month from akamai technologies, an internet services company.
asked about the times's allegations on thursday, a spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry said that "all such alleged attacks are groundless, irresponsible accusations lacking solid proof or reliable research results."
