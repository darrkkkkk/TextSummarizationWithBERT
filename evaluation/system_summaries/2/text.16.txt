what would happen to the body of the man who, along with his younger brother, dzhokhar, was accused of setting off two deadly explosions at the boston marathon on april 15 had been a nearly monthlong puzzle.
the body of tamerlan tsarnaev, killed in a police pursuit days after the bombings, went unclaimed for nearly two weeks.
peter stefan, owner of the worcester funeral home, said earlier this week that managers of three cemeteries told him they feared reprisals.
it also appeared that sending the body overseas was an unlikely option -- tamerlan tsarnaev's parents in the russian region of dagestan said they would not fly his body back to russia for burial, citing passport problems, spokeswoman heda saratova said.
