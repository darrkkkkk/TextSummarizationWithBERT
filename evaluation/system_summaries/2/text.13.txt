the person said law enforcement officials have some of the bomb components but do not yet know what was used to set off the explosives.separately, another federal law enforcement official who was not authorized to comment publicly said that circuit board material that may have been used to as part of a timing device was also found at the crime scene.
the description of the devices coincides with observations earlier by george velmahos, chief of trauma surgery at massachusetts general hospital, who said most of the injuries were "traumatic amputations" in which the blasts nearly blew off one victim's legs.
on tuesday, meanwhile, ehsanullah ehsan, a spokesman for the taliban in pakistan, told the afp news agency that it was not involved in the attack.
the officials also said they were interviewing hundreds of witnesses and examining surveillance tapes around the time that the blasts killed three people and injured at least 176, including 17 in critical condition.
