after tsarnaev returned to the united states in mid-july, a video of an islamic militant known as abu dujana was posted and then removed from tsarnaev's youtube channel.
during the trip, she said, what surprised her and others in the family was the way tsarnaev's behavior had changed since he went to the united states in 2003.
tsarnaev was born in 1986 in kyrgyzstan to an ethnically chechen family, his uncle said last week.
suleimanova said tsarnaev traveled to chechnya twice, likely going to see his father's family in gudermes and chiriyurt -- towns less than 200 kilometers (about 125 miles) away that were flashpoints in fighting between russian forces and chechan rebels during their longstanding tensions in 1990s.
