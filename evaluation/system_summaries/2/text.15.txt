handguns, a rifle and at least six bombs -- three of which exploded -- were found at the scene early friday after officers first confronted the two boston marathon bombing suspects in the darkness of a residential street, the watertown, massachusetts, police chief said saturday in an interview with cnn's wolf blitzer.
sean collier, a campus police officer at the massachusetts institute of technology, was responding to a loud disturbance call when one of the brothers shot him in his cruiser, deveau said.
investigators are still combing through all the crime scenes, including the boat, so deveau said he didn't have details yet on what items tsarnaev may have had with him when he was captured.
"we estimate there was over 200 shots fired in a five- to 10-minute period," deveau said.
