the fbi is likely issuing subpoenas for records from cell towers in the area to isolate and trace calls from around copley square at the time of the blasts, according to a federal law enforcement official.
scraps of them found at the scene of the twin bombings are being sent to the fbi's national laboratory, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices, the federal agent leading the investigation said tuesday.
the pieces recovered so far suggest the devices, which were identical, could carry 6 liters (1.5 gallons) of liquid apiece, a boston law enforcement source said.
a saudi woman, a medical student who was also injured in the blast, has also been interviewed by investigators, according to a law enforcement source.
