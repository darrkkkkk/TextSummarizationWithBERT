the brothers used a remote control device similar those used to control toy cars to detonate the two bombs in boston, rep. dutch ruppersberger, a maryland democrat and member of the house select committee on intelligence, said wednesday.
hours after talking at length with u.s. and russian authorities, the father of the two suspects in last week's deadly boston marathon attack is set to fly to the united states -- and cooperate with authorities -- an activist working with the family told cnn.
the surviving suspect, dzhokhar, has indicated that his older brother tamerlan masterminded the attack and described he and his brother as self-radicalized jihadists, according to a u.s. government source.
dzhokhar tsarnaev has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death.
