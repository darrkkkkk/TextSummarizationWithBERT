u.s. officials learned after the bombings that russian officials had intercepted a 2011 phone call between the suspect's mother, living in dagestan, and one of her sons, in which they reportedly had a vague conversation about jihad, a law enforcement official told cnn earlier.
cnn has previously cited u.s. officials in reporting that dzhokhar said u.s. involvement in afghanistan and iraq were motivating factors behind the april 15 attack, which killed three people and wounded 275.
nearly 24 hours later, police found dzhokhar hiding in the boat after the owner called police to report someone was inside of it.
the writing on the inside of the boat dovetails with what dzhokhar, 19, told investigators questioning him in a boston hospital room shortly after his capture, the source said.
