in the 2011 massachusetts triple homicide, the middlesex county district attorney's office said at the time that the victims and two unknown perpetrators appeared to know each other and that it was not a random crime.
last month, cnn reported that plotnikov and six others died in a july 2012 firefight with russian forces in the southwestern republic of dagestan, while tsarnaev was visiting the region, according to a source briefed on the investigation.
ibragim todashev, who died during the interview with authorities, not only confessed to his direct role in slashing the throats of three people in waltham, massachusetts, but also fingered tsarnaev in the deaths, the official said wednesday.
todashev was arrested this month on a charge of aggravated battery after getting into a fight over a parking spot with a man and his son outside an orlando mall.
