while authorities have not said the raid sunday had anything to do with the boston marathon bombing, one of those killed was an associate of abu dujan, the slain leader of a militant islamist organization that produced at least one video that slain bombing suspect tamarlan tsarnaev apparently posted and later removed from a social media account, according to analysis by cnn and the site intelligence group.
over the weekend, an official with knowledge of the investigation told cnn that russian authorities had intercepted a phone call in early 2011 from one of the tsarnaev brothers in the u.s. to their mother in dagestan.
officials also believe massachusetts institute of technology police officer sean collier was killed by one or both of the brothers three days after the marathon attack, leading to the manhunt in which tamerlan tsarnaev, 26, was killed.
in developments monday, russian special forces killed two members of a jihadist group during an early morning raid in dagestan, a semi-autonomous republic in southern russia, two russian police sources told cnn.
